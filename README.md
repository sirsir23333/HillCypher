# HillCypher

The Hill Cipher is a cryptographic technique used for both encrypting and decrypting messages through matrix multiplications. In this method, one matrix represents the message, and another matrix serves as the key.

## Dependencies

Python 3

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine or copy the contents of the decoder.py, encoder.py, and hillCypher.py files to local files within the same directory.
Open your terminal at the location of these files.

## Encoding

To encode a message, execute the following command in your terminal: python encoder.py
You can choose to either use your own 9-digit key or generate a new one. Be sure to save the key if you plan to decode the message later. Once you have the key, provide the message, and the application will produce the encoded version.

## Decoding

To decode a message, simply provide the application with the encoded message and the corresponding 9-digit key. The application will work its magic and reveal the original message.
